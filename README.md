Summary of Findings
The Exploratory Data Analysis revealed several key insights into the Titanic disaster:

Gender and Survival: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.

Passenger Class and Survival: Survival rates were strongly correlated with passenger class, with first-class passengers having the highest survival rate and third-class passengers having the lowest.

Age and Survival: Younger passengers, particularly children, had a better chance of survival compared to older adults.

These findings suggest that social status, gender, and age were the most significant factors in a passenger's survival.
